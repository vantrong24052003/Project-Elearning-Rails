- **Theme:** E-learning platform with Instructor, Student, and Admin roles
- **Architecture:** MVC pattern with Dashboard (client) and Manage (admin) namespaces

## Categories Management - COMPLETED ✅
### Implementation Details:

- ✅ Search functionality with real-time filtering
- ✅ Responsive design with dark/light mode
- ✅ Proper error handling and validation

### Test Credentials:
- **Admin Account:** `trongdn2405@gmail.com` / `Admin123@`

## Test Infrastructure

### Test Helpers Available
```ruby
# Login helpers (to be created)
def login_as_admin
  post login_path, params: { 
    email: 'trongdn2405@gmail.com', 
    password: 'Admin123@' 
  }
end

def login_as_user(user = nil)
  # To be implemented
end
```

### Test Data
- **Admin Account:** trongdn2405@gmail.com / Admin123@
- **Fixtures:** To be created as needed
- **Factory patterns:** To be established

## Running Tests
- **Command:** `rails test` (standard Rails testing)
- **Prerequisites:** 
  - Database setup with test data
  - MCP proxy server running on localhost:5000
  - Test account credentials configured

## Development Guidelines Followed
- ✅ MCP Proxy usage for code analysis
- ✅ No comments in code - self-explanatory code only
- ✅ 7 standard Rails methods (index, show, new, create, edit, update, destroy)
- ✅ Code duplication prevention
- ✅ Clean code maintenance

## Known Issues
- **Initial state:** No tests written yet
- **Dependencies:** Need to analyze existing models and relationships first
- **Test patterns:** Need to establish reusable test helpers

## Next Steps
1. **Read existing models** using MCP proxy to understand relationships
2. **Analyze controller patterns** to understand current structure
3. **Create test helpers** for common operations (login, setup, etc.)
4. **Start with model tests** for validations and relationships
5. **Progress to controller tests** for each assigned feature
6. **Document test coverage** as features are completed
